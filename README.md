NeoPixel+Arduino+Vocaloid Hairband Strand Project

This is a nice multi-discipline maker project combining:

* some 3D-printed parts for a hairband and a light controller case
* some Arduino Pro Mini boards, perfboard assembly style,
* some code that goes in the Arduino Atmel 328, and
* some very long strands of NeoPixel (WS2812B) RGB LEDs.

The goal is a hairband that can be worn to a Vocaloid event;
the Vocaloids are Japanese animated characters with synthesized
vocal tracks and visuals.  The lights on the hairband match the
colors and rhythm that the wearer chooses to select at any time.
